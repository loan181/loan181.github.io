My very first step in programming, "Smiley's Adventure" is the first game that I did realise using Game Maker!
Navigate the dangerous maze with the smiley face to try to reach the green flag

The inspiration for it came from a random Game Maker tutorial on YouTube that I watched the first 2 minutes.
As you will see with the different project that I did, my infographics skills are pretty bad,
as such, most of the pictures were found on internet.
My lack of experience with the software also explains why most picture have strange white borders and strange animations.

The game controls are as bad as the visuals, my lack of knowledge in coding strike back.
It's quite common to get stuck and be forced to go back even if visually it should fit.
I discovered a few years after that the character picture actually have some black pixels around him which have collisions
as the background is also black, we can't see them and therefore realise the real "hit-box".

While we are on the topic of programming, an experienced programmer will probably be very sad to see the "code" 
(I used "programming blocks" back then).
Most of it have no purpose as it is used in context that does not make sense.

Despite all of its faults, it has a special place in my heart and some of its concepts was pretty interesting
(and will actually be reuse in future projects).
For instance; the fake walls which destroy on collision, having another object moving with the player control, etc.

In a nutshell, this game is not extraordinary, but have the privilege of being my very first real programming experience,
guiding me to what would become my biggest passion in life even until now!
