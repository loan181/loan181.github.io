After the enthusiasm of finishing the first game,
I thought I was good enough to attempt a bigger much more ambitious project;
my first MMORPG project!

{% include gm-details.html %}

Little did I know that even today with all the experience that I have,
this kind of idea would take me years to develop.

This game will also be the start of a long series of cancelled games/projects.
Each teaching something new that I should be more careful on.
For this particular project for instance: 
I realised that it was too ambitious and 
my lack of drawing was also starting to be an issue as I was relying on what I can find online.
This is why the next project would use assets that can easily be found.
