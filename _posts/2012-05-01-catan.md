After another failure, I had the idea of doing a video game based of a board game!
[Catan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan) being one of my favorite (still today),
I choose it as my next video game project.

Just like the previous ninja game, this does not have much to offer.
Unfortunately, the online demo have a bug which prevent to enjoy the game at its fullest.
After rolling the dice you should in theory have yellow ring to highlight the tile corresponding to the dice sum.

This game was cancelled as I had no idea how to do the rest of the game:
 - how display cards so that other player don't see them ?
 - how check wherever the player can build a certain element or not ?
 - how store all of this information ?

It was obviously too early for this kind of projects and I underestimate the concepts that this game would require.

However, I did learn some new tricks, and I was able to master more and more randomisation aspects in video game.
I also made the conclusion that if board game was on board, it was for a good reason!
