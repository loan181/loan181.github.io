As a The Legend of Zelda fan, why not making my own perfect version of the game ?

The previous project teach me that I needed to find game graphics online.
As I loved the esthetics of The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,
I did reuse its game assets for my own project.

  Once the game started, feel free to mute all sounds in the menu after pressing `esc`.

I spent so much time of this project, the assets were there,
but my lack of programming experience made me losing a lot of times on basic concepts.

I finally gave up when I realised how much time it should take to create an entire world.
Even recreating the existing world would have taken me months.
I did figure out that if they were a whole team of developers, it was for a good reason!
