Looks like I really love this saga to came back to it a second time!
This time focusing less on the map and more on the different game mechanics (items, enemies, etc.)

{% include gm-details.html width=240 height=160 %}

Better than the [previous version]({% post_url 2012-03-21-zelda-3 %}) for sure, there is a lot of improvements
regarding various aspects of the game.

If you go on the top left of the map you will actually find an experience bar and the magic bar.
Once the magic bar you can't throw any more spells.
When the experience bar is full... Nothing happen !

Unfortunately, the game was abandoned once again.
I was pretty proud of what I achieved,
but there was still so much to do and I made some bad choices on certain aspects;
how to handle the water, flying, hookshot through platform to reach further places ?
