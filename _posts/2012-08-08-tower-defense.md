Trying myself in a new game genre with the tower-defense one.
It will be the last Game Maker project that I canceled. Once again, too complicated.

Not much to say on this one, making this kind of game was far more complicate than
what I anticipated. 
The project was quickly stopped after struggling on the turret placement.
