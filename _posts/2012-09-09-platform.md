At this point, I was trying to focus myself to make a simpler game.
Don't focus on the design on which I struggle so much 
but rather on a simple fun gameplay.

{% include gm-details.html %}

The gameplay iteself is very simple, a basic platformer game.
You are a pink/purple square trying to reach the end of the level (checkboard square).
You have the possibility to double jump by pressing the jump button in mid-air.
Each level contains 3 hidden coins that will increase your score.
The red/orange blocks are lava which will kill you on contact.
Blue arrow blocks will act as trampoline forcing the player to jump in the air.
The trampoline mechanic is a bit random, sometime you will bounce very high, sometime very low.

After 8 cancelled project, finally I was starting to learn and was able to
complete my games.
Starting this project, it would be quite rare that the game are unfinished.
