Little arcade game on which you will have to avoid the fire flame which come
from the side of the screen

{% include gm-details.html %}

Like the previous game, more focus on a simple gameplay.

You will notice  a little more effort on the display.
The score and the health appear for a short time when their value are modified.

The bonus system is similar to [Space Attack]({% post_url 2012-07-05-space-attack %}),
coins grant you some score, there is a shield power which protect you from an attack and some health.

This game was inspired from a [New Super Mario Bros.](https://www.mariowiki.com/New_Super_Mario_Bros.) mini-game: 
[Danger, Bob-omb! Danger!](https://www.mariowiki.com/Danger,_Bob-omb!_Danger!).

I think I realised that it was pretty boring and redundant. The score system have no purpose as it is not saved
(unlike the previous game).
It was a nice little challenge but I was bored by the idea of re-doing a score saving system.
