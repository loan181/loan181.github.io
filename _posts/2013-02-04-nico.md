Shoot the head of this mysterious man to get the high score!
Be aware that his head will split in 4 others smaller heads when shot!

{% include gm-details.html %}

Little joke that I did to my former brother-in-law for his birthday.

The game is pretty close from [KillBox]({% post_url 2012-09-28-killbox %}),
the main difference is that the head move in every direction and bounce each other.

The normal head grant 20 points when shot, while the smaller ones grant 50 points.

The game finish whenever you shoot a bomb or the timer times-out.
