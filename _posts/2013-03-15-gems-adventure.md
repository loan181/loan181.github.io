This is another game that I am really proud of.
I did put a lot of effort and time to have a polished, complete and fun game.

From a gameplay point of view, I did my best so that the core mechanics are easy enough to guess without the need to read
the manual or spoil yourself with the map. 

There is 4 core mechanics which are important to finish the game:
 1. Fake walls: go through the "lighter" colored walls, they are fake!
 2. "Flipswitch" tile (in the portal puzzled toom): switch them all on to move to create the portal
 3. Hookshot: grab certain objects to get pulled towards them
 4. Gun: shoot the status to destroy them

If you have seen the previous games, you will realise that it mixes some concepts seen in previous games:
 - [Smiley Adventure]({% post_url 2011-12-12-smiley-adventure %}) for its title and the concept of fake walls
 - [Smiley Adventure]({% post_url 2011-12-15-dungeon-and-dragon %}) for the introduction (it is the same pictures)
 - [Zelda 3]({% post_url 2012-03-21-zelda-3 %}) for the idea of shooting projectiles, hookshot mechanics and adventure feel
 
Maybe we can consider this game as my revenge over my frustrations of having abandoned this games ?
After all, I did programmed for about 1 year at this point, 
I could prove myself that I did learn a lot since the beginning.
