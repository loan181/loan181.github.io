Casual skill game where you have to reach the end as fast as possible while dodging the different obstacles.
Your best time is saved on each level, improve it to become a real legend.

This game is pretty similar to [Avoid]({% post_url 2012-10-14-avoid %}),
except from the fact that this project was planned to have several level with an increasing difficulty and the best time
saving mechanism.

In practice, it is a mix of two existing games:
1. [World's Hardest Game](https://www.crazygames.com/game/worlds-hardest-game) for the "dodging" part of the game
2. [Marble Blast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_Blast) for the "best time" mechanic. I used to play this game a lot as it was preinstalled on the family laptop

No playable demo for this project as there was a big bug that could cause damage to the computer.
I was lacking the knowledge on how to save the "best time" data, as such, 
I accidentally save it as a way which corrupted my computer and GameMaker.
As such, I was obliged to reset the computer entirely a few times which make me drop this project.
