Puzzle game that challenges players to navigate through a series of rooms by flipping them strategically.
Your objective? Reach the goal at the end of each level while avoiding treacherous hazards like deadly spikes.
But here's the twist: you can flip the entire room, changing the layout and revealing new paths!

To progress, you'll need to use your wits to solve intricate puzzles.
Search for keys scattered throughout the room to unlock doors blocking your way, 
and strategically use crates to bridge gaps and overcome obstacles. 
Each level presents a unique challenge, requiring careful planning to conquer.

Are you ready to flip your way to victory?

This game play a lot with the camera. When the room flip, the actual camera rotate and the gravity change to apply
to the room objects.

An interesting aspects regarding this game is that there is more automation on redundant tasks.
For instance, the room layout is set in advance, but the tile that composed the blocks is chosen automatically
when the room loads.

This is reminiscent from [Tank Tank Attack]({% post_url 2013-10-23-tank-tank-attack %}) level editor 
on which water tiles are chosen automatically.
