Website introducing machine learning (artificial intelligence) concepts.
Subject of my master thesis, the targeted public was young students without specific computer science knowledge.

The website link is: 
## <https://loan181.github.io/master-thesis-website-ia-introduction/>

The master thesis report is also publicly available at:
<https://dial.uclouvain.be/memoire/ucl/object/thesis:19484>

The website cover 3 different topics:
 1. [Decision Trees](https://loan181.github.io/master-thesis-website-ia-introduction/algo/arbre/)
 2. [k-nearest Neighbors Algorithm](https://loan181.github.io/master-thesis-website-ia-introduction/algo/KNN/)
 3. [Neural Network](https://loan181.github.io/master-thesis-website-ia-introduction/algo/NN/)

Each topic is composed of:

Theoretical Introduction
 : Describe the concept in an accessible way. This is followed by examples of practical uses.

Practical Exercises
 : Given a simple example, questions regarding the concept for the example. The exercises are automatically corrected by
the website itself. After three failed attempts, the website will propose to show the correction with some explanations.
A button at the end of the page will propose for the faster or more curious people additional harder exercises.

Project/Activity
 : A goal is set that the user have to reach to succeed at it. Most of them are [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly)
projects. Except the Decision Tree which is an interactive tree creation.

Just like the website you are currently looking at, this project was also developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
This is actually this master thesis project which inspire me for this portfolio website project almost 4 years after.
